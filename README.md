# Repo template

Use this repo as a starting point for new repositories, if it suits you.

When using with your own repo you'll need to install pre-commit and then initialize it in the repo.

Installation can be done with pip:
```shell
pip install pre-commit
```

And init:
```
pre-commit install
```
